      <h3>Browse for a TM or HM</h3>
      <p>In Pokemon, a Machine is a disc that you can use to teach a new move to your Pokemon (don't ask how - no one knows how this makes sense).</p>
        <p>A TM or Technical Machine is a move that can be taught and then replaced by another, whereas an HM or Hidden Machine cannot be forgotten 
        other than through a Move Deleter. They also usually need a gym badge to be able to used outside of battle to overcome obstacles 
        like cutting down trees or moving boulders.
      </p>
      <p>Try type in the name of a TM or HM move that you'd want to find out about.
        If you're not sure, you can browse the entire library of 95 TMs and 6 HMs .
